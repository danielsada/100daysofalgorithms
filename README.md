# 100daysofalgorithms

Hello! I'm Daniel Sada. I've covered most of this algorithms in classes before, but I didn't implement them myself, and see what roadblocks I've got. I'm trying to do an algorithm or two a day or at least try to solve a problem a day. I'll be alternating between new algorithms and working in problems with those algorithms.
